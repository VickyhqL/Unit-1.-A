Question 1: Do you think it is necessary to involve the show owner during the process along the three weeks? Or alternatively, is it better to involve him only when the product is finished? Explain your answer
I do think it is necessary to involve the show owner during the process. THis is because you are creating a product for them and if there are changes they wish to make during the development process it would be far easier to change while you are working rather than after.

Question 2: Do you think it is necessary to create MVPs for your game? If so, what would some of the MPV look like and what do you expect to obtain from the client?
Yes. I think I should create MVPs. Since the game itself captures an overarching plot I could present the game in "acts" much like plays and submit each act at different stages. Eg in my first submission I would submit 1 act and in the next I would submit 2. I would like to know if the client likes the way decisions impact the plot and their gaming experience.
